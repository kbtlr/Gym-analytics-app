# Gym-analytics-app

An idea to allow a user to graphically and numerically track their gym stats in real time, such as weight loss, volume increase/decrease, and personal bests over a mesaure of time. This way, they have a visual measure of their progress, and can use this to influence future training plans.

Initial focus on frontend, and producing a working entry screen and initial input.
